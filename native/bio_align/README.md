# NIF for Elixir.Bio.Align
Original source code and license for `needleman_wunsch` and `hirschberg` are
from the
[`sequence_align`](https://github.com/kensho-technologies/sequence_align)
project.

Source code was modified to allow compilation with Rustler, as well as idiomatic
errors and returns to Elixir.
